# Udacity Frontend Web Developer Nanodegree - Project 7
## Neighborhood Map Intro

This project displays a website with a map. The map markers denote restraurants in the Orange County, California area. 

The sidebar allows users to search and filter down the restaurant results as desired. The sidebar results are filtered, as well as the markers on the map itself.

The website can be accessed offline after visiting it once to store various elements in the browser cache.

The website was built with the mobile-first approach so that it looks appropriate in different viewports. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It uitlizes the Google Maps API as well as Foursquare API.
